## Background

### What is DeFi? 

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for an array of financial applications built on top of a blockchain network. With the use of smart contracts, DeFi offers financial services that is open-source, permissionless, and transparent to users. It aims to disrupt the traditional financial system by providing peer-to-peer finance-enabled decentralized applications. This leads to a financial service network that is available to everyone and functions without central authorities.

As of November 2020, the US dollar value of locked in DeFi is 12.81 billion compared in Janury 2020 which was $675.59M. In a span of 10 monhts, the DeFi sector has grown tremendously. 

### What is NFT?

Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a cryptographic token that represents ownership of a digital or real-world asset. Unlike the fungibility of certain goods that makes it interchangeable and indistinguishable from each other, the element of non-fungibility makes an NFT unique, rare, and indivisible. NFTs can be used as collectibles in art and  gaming or as assets in the virtual world. Famous examples of NFTs are CryptoKitties, Decentraland, and Gods Unchained.  

The popularity of NFTs and its numerous use cases can unlock more potential for DeFi. Most of the DeFi protocols have lending and borrowing solution and using NFTs as collateral is a feasible idea. 

### What is P2P Lending? 

Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in fintech refers to the exchange of cryptocurrencies via distributed network. A P2P platform allows borrowers and lenders to execute loans without the need of intermediaries. 

Various digital assets can be used as collateral for a loan in P2P platform. The loan is secured through a smart contract. The loan interest rate is based on the amount of cryptocurrency the borrower uses a collateral. Some platforms calculate interest rates on the Loan-to-Value (LTV) of the loan.   

### Yield Farming/Staking

Yield farming is a way to multiply a user’s cryptocurrency using his cryptocurrency holdings. It involves lending funds to borrowers through smart contracts. With this, a user can earn fees or interests in the form of cryptocurrency. Similarly, yield farming can be paralleled with staking. 

Staking is a less resource-intensive alternative to mining. It also involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to invest in blockchain network operations and security. Just like in yield farming, locking up cryptocurrencies will generate more rewards for the user.  

## Project Introduction 

### What is SparkDeFi?

SparkDeFi is a governance token-based DeFi platform that empowers individuals to unlock the true value of their cryptocurrency assets. It offers a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), Multi-Staking, P2P Lending and Borrowing, and DeFi Assets Protocols Management in a seamless, transparent, secure, inclusive, and interoperable approach.

With the SparkDeFi platform, users have the opportunity to choose from different staking options to earn from their assets. They can leverage their crypto assets including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as collateral while earning from savings pools in P2P Lending. Users can also manage their crypto assets portfolio in our DeFi Assets Protocols Management dashboard.

### What are the advantages of SparkDeFi?

SparkDeFi has the following advantages: 

* One of the first few projects to adopt Binance Smart Chain

&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the SparkDeFi solutions will run on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) except the SRK-ETH Liquidity Staking. SparkDeFi’s deployment on BSC allows the platform to have faster and cheaper transactions. 

* Fully transparent, non-pseudonymous team that has good track record

&nbsp;&nbsp; The SparkPoint team, the group behind SparkDeFi, has good track record of launching blockchain-based products and services like SparkPoint Wallet, SparkLearn, SparkPlay, and SparkEarn. 

* Location of the company

&nbsp;&nbsp; SparkPoint Innovations Inc., the company that developed SparkDeFi, is situated in the Philippines. The company is taking advantage of the the Philippine government’s openness in accepting blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. 

* Existing SRK token 

&nbsp;&nbsp; The SRK token is one of the few tokens with a return on investment (ROI) of over 1,000% according to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. SRK leads the BitMart’s 2020 Top 10 Crypto Gainers with 4,553.25% year-to-date return rate in USDT. 

### What is SparkDeFi trying to solve?

SparkDeFi aims to bring the world closer to a utopian society built on top of a strong free market and away from disproportionately high commission charging intermediaries that serve antiquated purposes. 

Furthermore, SparkDeFi addresses the following concerns in DeFi:

* SparkDeFi addresses the lack of interoperability by choosing Binance Smart Chain to power its platform because it can support users across multiple blockchains. 

* SparkDeFi revolutionizes P2P Lending by allowing various cryptocurrency assets like altcoins, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and crypto-collectibles like game items, virtual estate, and digital art as collateral which are currently untapped by the existing DeFi lending protocols.

* SparkDeFi supports financial inclusion by offering a more all-encompassing approach in terms of lending. These approaches include a lower barrier to entry, minimal loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and microlending which serves as another provision in solving overcollateralization through small, low-interest loans to borrowers.
